            <p>
              Cha Eun-ho is a successful author and a chief editor at a book
              publishing company. Kang Dan-i is a mother and former successful
              advertising copywriter. When Cha Eun-ho was a child, Kang Dan-i
              saved him from an accident and was injured. Kang Dan-i had Cha
              Eun-ho help her while she was recuperating in hospital and later
              on bedrest for one year. By helping her acquire books to read from
              the library, Cha Eun-ho himself became interested in writing. The
              two youngsters stayed close friends well into adulthood. However,
              their friendship was strained after Kang Dan-i started dating a
              selfish, inconsiderate man. Although he disapproved of her choice
              in a partner, and she too expressed doubt at times, Kang Dan-i
              stands by her decision to marry this man.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now in the present, Cha Eun-ho enlists Kang Dan-i to help him find
              a housekeeper - but he has no idea Kang Dan-i is the one doing the
              work and taking payment. Her husband has cheated on her, and she
              is now divorced and unemployed, but he is also unaware of her
              living situation and the hardships she is facing as a divorced
              single mother with a large gap in work experience trying to
              re-enter the professional world. Eventually Kang Dan-i is no
              longer able to keep her secrets from him, and Cha Eun-ho lends her
              a helping hand. Their lives become even more intertwined when Kang
              Dan-i applies to be a temporary task support worker at his
              publishing company. Although Cha Eun-ho is initially worried about
              how she will perform, Kang Dan-i surprises him and other senior
              executives with her creativity and hard work.
            </p>
            <p>
              The rest of the series is about the personal and professional
              challenges they face as they slowly start to realize their true
              feelings for each other and navigate this next stage of their
              lives.

              <h3>Filming Locations</h3>
              <p>
                The filming locations for this K-drama were almost all in Seoul,
                South Korea. This link has many of the locations and where you
                can find them now! From book stores to a high school, its got it
                all. My favorite has to be the Arc N Book. This place is a book
                store that appears in th eleventh episode and it presents a
                modern look.
              </p>
              <p>
                Along with being a modern store, the Arc N Book offers a
                lifestyle shop. This store is also open later with it closing at
                10pm.
